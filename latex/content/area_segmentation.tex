\section{Segmentation of land zones}

\subsection{Preparing the dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain any transformations that have been applied to the dataset
    \item state how the labels were defined/represented
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the Neural Network}
\begin{itemize}
    \item show the chosen architectures of all tested models
    \item describe the idea behind the architectural decisions
    \item analyze how the NN works internally (e. g. visualize feature/confidence maps)
    \item explain the data format for the resulting database
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item have a look at the segments that were found by the NN
    \item compare segments to the real landscape in the dataset
    \item discuss practical use of those results for identifying emergency landing fields
    \item evaluate results and assess which data to use for the vegetation analysis
\end{itemize}
