\subsection{Background}
\cite{feu_fas}
failure of aircraft engine is serious event, requires quick and informed actions. Many reasons for aircraft engine failure, for example bird strike or technical issues.

normal aircrafts can become a glider without engine. pilot has then to find a runway or another suitable landing field. pilot has to consider many facts like wind and gliding characteristics to choose an appropriate flight path. has to get to the runway with correct height and approaching angle. this is a though situation.

FernUni Hagen develops an emergency landing assistant (ELA) to find a good path to the next runway. Considering sink rates, wind speed/direction, different rolls/angles, etc. Also doing simulations if the calculated paths are really possible to do. But not every time a runway matching the aircraft's requirements is close enough, so it is a good thing to also evaluate emergency landing fields.


\cite{feu_elfi}
emergency landing fields are always the last option, because of high risks. Therefore looking for fields with low probability of a crash landing. Depends on many factors like inclination, vegetation and land use.

With Emergency Landing Field Identification (ELFI) it is possible to automatically determine landing fields using LIDAR elevation data. very high resolution, grid size under 1m, but still not enough to spot fences, creeks, power lines. additional use of image data allows analyzing surface conditions. Idea is, to use CNN with image segmentation.

\subsection{Objectives}
improve emergency landing field identification using NN models, extending existing segmentation architectures. use orthographic photos data set of Cologne with very high resolution.

First goal is to do semantic segmentation on land cover. Identify different classes of land usage like buildings, forest, agriculture. results will be visualized and compared to real situation. also saved in postgres database with postGIS extension. this allows for future use of the data. with that a first filtering of suitable emergency landing fields can be applied, because certain land areas are more suitable than others.

% TODO make sure the wording is correct (regression model)
Build on those results, a second step analyzes vegetation density. only areas that are identified as  agriculture/field will be looked at, so much smaller dataset. idea is to have a regression model that maps vegetation density to floats between 0 and 1. Also save this in postGIS database. Visualize results and discuss thresholds for detecting landing fields. Different airplanes can have different requirements and limits for this.
