\section{Conclusion}
\WIP{
\begin{itemize}
    \item U-Net showed best results for segmentation. but results are still not sufficient to automate identification of landing fields.
    \item use data set with more accurate labels. for example Google Maps Static API. Combine it with some other data set to have distinction between forest/agriculture.
    \item SVIs are not consistent. data set was not good for this purpose. in general, only tells about green/living vegetation. but also dead vegetation is critical for landing fields.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item reflect on the results achieved with the thesis in relation to the objectives
    \item investigate practical usability and limits of the developed models
    \item express ideas how the results/models can be further improved
\end{itemize}
