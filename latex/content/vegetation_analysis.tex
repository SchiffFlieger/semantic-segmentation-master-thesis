\section{Analysis of vegetation density}

\subsection{Preparing the dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain differences to the dataset used for segmentation
    \item state how the labels were defined/represented
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the Neural Network}
\begin{itemize}
    \item show the chosen architectures of all tested models
    \item describe the idea behind the architectural decisions
    \item analyze how the NN works internally (e. g. visualize feature/confidence maps)
    \item explain the data format for the resulting database
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item compare results to the real landscape in the dataset
    \item discuss practical use of those results for identifying emergency landing fields
\end{itemize}
