\section{On the Deployment for Practical Use}
\WIP{

two selected models are provided as docker images. docker image includes all dependencies like Python interpreter and packages. also model definition and trained weights. this allows easy usage for inference.

docker images are available publicly in docker hub in \texttt{imageseg/terrain-segmentation} repository. two tags in the repository, one for U-Net the other for DenseNet.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Thoughts how to provide the trained models for practical use.
    \item designing an API
    \item packaging into a docker image
\end{itemize}
